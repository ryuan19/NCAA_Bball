Exploring how external factors affect the outcomes of games. By external factors, we mean factors which are not related to statistics derived from play on the court like points allowed, points scored, etc. More specifically, we want to look into how statistics outside of the players’ control impact a game’s outcome between evenly-matched teams, which are teams with similar win-loss records/seeding in tournaments.   Some features we hope to explore are team color, the day of the week a game is played on, and the venue location (home, away, or neutral). Supplementary questions include if these factors can alter game outcomes.
